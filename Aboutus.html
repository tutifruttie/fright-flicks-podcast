            <h1>About the podcast</h1>
        
            <p>In this podcast we dive deep into the chilling narratives and unsettling visuals of films from studios like A24.<Br>
                We’ve read lots of reviews in the past and possess extensive knowledge in this area.
                That’s how we build the experience in the horror film industry.<Br>
                 We not only focus on success but are truly determined to build a connection with every listener of our podcast, ensuring they feel acknowledged.
                 We listen their opinions and try to expand our vision.<Br>
                 What sets us apart is that we are still very young and have a distinctive fashion style, music preferences and a unique way of thinking.<Br>
                 “We don't want to be a part of the demographics. We want to be an individual. That's also why we cherish all the bad reviews. If the critics start liking our opinion, then were in deep trouble.”<Br>
                 This is what makes us inspiring for people who also are searching for there identity and voice in this world.<Br>
    
                We believe that every frame tells a story and every sound amplifies the terror.<Br>
                Overal a movie is not just the pictures. It’s the story and it’s the perspective and it’s the tempo and it’s the silence and it’s the music.<Br>
                Toghether, we'll dissect the artistry behind the scares, exploring how photography, sound design, and composition create an atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll.<Br>
                Join us as we celebrate the craft of horror and uncover the psychological depths that keep us on the edge of our sets.<Br>
                Let's discover what makes these films truly spine-chilling!</p>

                    Hi, I’m a 17 year-old girl who is passionate about film.<Br>
                       I would describe myself as a young alternative person who doesn’t fit into society.<Br>
                       Over time we've developed a distinct perspective and thought process that has attracted me into horror films as a form of self-expression.<Br>
                       Because of our interest in music combined with the craft of horror filmmaking, we emphasize the cinematography of the movie.<Br>
